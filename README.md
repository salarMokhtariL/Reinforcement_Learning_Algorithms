## Overview

Reinforcement learning is a cutting-edge approach for training agents to make sequential decisions through interaction with an environment. This repository provides implementations of popular RL algorithms, accompanied by code explanations and theoretical insights to guide users through the learning process.

The repository is structured to allow easy experimentation and customization of each algorithm.

## Implemented Algorithms

The following RL algorithms are implemented in this repository:

- **Value-based Methods**
  - Q-Learning
  - Deep Q-Network (DQN)
  - Double DQN
  - Dueling DQN
- **Policy-based Methods**
  - REINFORCE
  - Actor-Critic
- **Advanced Algorithms**
  - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
  - Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
  - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)

Each algorithm is developed with modular and reusable components, including environment interaction modules, networks, and replay buffers.

## Documentation

This repository includes detailed PDF documents that explain each algorithmâ€™s theory and code step-by-step. These resources are ideal for users who want to deepen their understanding of RL algorithms beyond the code alone.

The documentation includes:

- **Algorithm Explanations**: In-depth descriptions covering the mathematical foundations, pseudocode, and intuition behind each algorithm.
- **Code Walkthroughs**: Step-by-step guides explaining the code implementations, helping users understand the structure and functionality of each component.

You can find these documents in the `docs/` directory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
